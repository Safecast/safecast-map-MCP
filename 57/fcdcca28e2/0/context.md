## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

can we inclided the users informaion in the queries of the MCP?:

Unfortunately, the list_tracks MCP tool doesn't include uploader/username information in its results — it only returns track_id, marker_count, first_id, last_id, and index. There's no way to filter by user through the available MCP tools.
The MCP server simply doesn't expose that data field. To get your personal track count, you'd need to check your profile directly on the Safecast website. It might be worth adding a user filter...

### Prompt 2

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 4

### Prompt 5
