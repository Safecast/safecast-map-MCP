Perfect! I've now fixed the **actual MCP server code** that will affect Claude CLI and all other clients. I updated the tool descriptions for:

1. [tool_sensor_current.go:11](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_current.go#L11)
2. [tool_sensor_history.go:12](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_history.go#L12)  
3. [tool_device_history.go:11](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_device_history.go#L11)

Each now explicitly states: **"CPM means 'counts per minute' (NOT counts per second)"**

To deploy this fix, you'll need to:

```bash
cd /home/rob/Documents/Safecast/safecast-map-MCP/go
go build ./cmd/mcp-server/
```

Then deploy the new binary to your VPS, or push the changes and let the GitHub Actions workflow deploy it automatically.
