Excellent! I've successfully added automatic CPM to µSv/h conversion instructions to both test clients. Here's what changed:

## Changes Made

### 1. [webite entry.go:411-424](test/webite entry.go#L411-L424) (Qwen agent)
Added a "UNIT CONVERSION REQUIREMENT" section with:
- Clear instruction to always present measurements in µSv/h, not CPM
- Detector-specific conversion factors for 7 common Geiger-Müller tubes
- Guidance for handling unknown detector types

### 2. [claude_web.go:63-76](test/claude_web.go#L63-L76) (Claude CLI agent)
Added the same conversion instructions to ensure consistent behavior

## How This Works

Now when the AI receives data that includes CPM values, it will:

1. **Identify the detector type** from the response (usually in fields like `detector`, `tube`, or `device_name`)
2. **Apply the correct conversion factor** based on the tube type:
   - **J305** (standard bGeigie): CPM ÷ 100
   - **SBM-20** (common Russian tube): CPM ÷ 175.43
   - **LND 7317** (pancake tube): CPM ÷ 334
   - And 4 other common tubes
3. **Present all results in µSv/h** for consistency and better user understanding

### Example:
If a sensor reports "500 CPM" with a J305 tube, the AI will automatically convert and display: **"5.0 µSv/h"** (500 ÷ 100)

The conversion factors are based on standard calibration values for each tube model and account for their different sensitivities to gamma radiation. This ensures accurate dose rate reporting across different detector types!
