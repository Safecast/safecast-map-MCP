### Prompt 1

Can you modify the Github action for the msimplemap that it deploys to the simplemap server. After succesfull build, first the service need to be stopped then with rsyn the new binary trafert and then the service need to be restarted. But I think you know what is needed.

### Prompt 2

where on the server is  the new binary  stored?

### Prompt 3

Seems corrcet.  So if a new buld is made, Github action will autodeploy the new build to the server?
