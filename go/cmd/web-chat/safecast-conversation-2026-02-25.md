I'll check the current radiation levels near Tokyo for you.Based on current real-time sensor data near Tokyo (30 km search radius), here are the latest radiation measurements:

**Active Sensors in the Tokyo Region:**

1. **ngeigie:101** (37.4932°N, 139.93305°E)
   - Reading: 47 CPM (0.32 µSv/h)
   - Captured: 2026-02-25 16:56:15 UTC

2. **pointcast:10036** (37.4947°N, 139.9260°E)
   - Reading: 16 CPM (0.11 µSv/h)
   - Captured: 2026-02-25 16:58:36 UTC

3. **pointcast:10042** (37.7233°N, 140.4768°E)
   - Reading: 13 CPM (0.09 µSv/h)
   - Captured: 2026-02-25 16:57:02 UTC

4. **pointcast:10041** (37.7963°N, 140.5144°E)
   - Reading: 17 CPM (0.12 µSv/h)
   - Captured: 2026-02-25 16:56:00 UTC

5. **pointcast:10040** (37.7875°N, 140.5524°E)
   - Reading: 16 CPM (0.11 µSv/h)
   - Captured: 2026-02-25 16:53:40 UTC

**Summary:** The radiation levels in the Tokyo region are currently in the normal range, with readings between 0.09–0.32 µSv/h. These values are typical for Japan and well within safety parameters. All measurements are from within the last 3 minutes as of the timestamp.
