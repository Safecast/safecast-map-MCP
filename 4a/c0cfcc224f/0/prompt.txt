● Latest Radiation Reading from Yokohama                                                                        
                                                                                                                
  Location: Yokohama (35.476°N, 139.572°E)                                                                      
  Sensor: note:dev:864475044253671 (Notehub device)
  Reading Time: February 16, 2026 at 9:22 AM (just a few hours ago)                                             
                                                                                                                
  Radiation Level: 27.59 CPS (counts per second)
                                                                                                                
  This reading is measured in counts per second from an LND 7318C Geiger tube. Converting to more common units: 
  - Approximately 0.08 μSv/h (microsieverts per hour)                                                           
                                                                                                                
  Context:

  This radiation level is normal background radiation. For reference:
  - Typical background radiation: 0.05-0.30 μSv/h
  - The reading in Yokohama is well within the safe range
  - This is similar to natural background radiation found in most locations worldwide

The radiation level was saved in CPM , but repoeted in CPS. Can you correct that ?
