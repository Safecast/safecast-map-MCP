Can you check the VPS for issues with Redis?
We got a complain:

> Dear Sir or Madam,
>
> Redis is an open-source in-memory database server with a simple
> key-value data structure often used with dynamic web applications.
>
> If a Redis server is openly accessible from the Internet and no
> SASL authentification has been configured, anyone who can connect
> to the server has unrestricted access to the data stored with it.
> This allows attackers to modify or delete any data or potentially
> steal sensitive information like login credentials for web
> applications or customer data from online shops.
>
> Please find below a list of affected systems hosted on your network.
> The timestamp (timezone UTC) indicates when the system was found
> to be running an openly accessible Redis server.
>
> We would like to ask you to check this issue and take appropriate
> steps to secure the Redis servers on the affected systems or
> notify your customers accordingly.
>
> If you have recently solved the issue but received this notification
> again, please note the timestamp included below. You should not
> receive any further notifications with timestamps after the issue
> has been solved.
