Can you check this?:


"The CloudFront distribution for simplemap.safecast.org is missing a /api/* behavior, so API calls return oversized HTML and cause a ResponseTooLargeError. Could you please add a cache behavior for /api/* that forwards to the same Apache origin as /mcp-http and /docs/* (no caching, forward query strings). If you have access to the server"

I checked a bit more seems to work fine now.

One other issues. How can we fix this?:
Based on those timestamps, the Notehub sensor appeared to be the most recent. However, when I then fetched the actual current reading from each sensor:

note:dev:863740067246360: 2026-02-24T05:25:09Z
geigiecast-zen:65002: 2026-02-24T07:49:40Z (nearly 2.5 hours later!)

This reveals that the last_reading_at field in the list_sensors results was not current - it was showing stale metadata from days ago, not reflecting the actual latest readings available in the database.
This is clearly a data synchronization issue with the realtime_measurements table metadata. The sensor list is showing cached or outdated "last reading" timestamps that don't match the actual most recent measurements in the database.
So to properly answer your original question: geigiecast-zen:65002 has the latest reading at 07:49:40 UTC today, not the Notehub sensor. I should have checked both sensors' current readings before concluding which was most recent. Good catch!

Seems the MCP server is not correct: when doing a query no data is returned..
