Perfect! I've made the health check more robust:

1. **Increased initial wait**: From 3 to 10 seconds
2. **Added retry logic**: Will try up to 5 times with 5-second delays between attempts
3. **Total wait time**: Up to ~35 seconds for the server to fully start

This should handle the case where the server takes longer to initialize after restart. The changes are in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](. github/workflows/deploy.yml#L63-L89).
