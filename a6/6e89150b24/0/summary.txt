Perfect! I've added unit correction logic to all three tools that return sensor data:

1. **[tool_sensor_current.go:154-159](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_current.go#L154-L159)** - Corrects CPS → CPM
2. **[tool_sensor_history.go:145-150](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_history.go#L145-L150)** - Corrects CPS → CPM  
3. **[tool_device_history.go:164-169](go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_device_history.go#L164-L169)** - Corrects CPS → CPM

The MCP server will now automatically fix the incorrect "CPS" label in the database to the correct "CPM" before sending the data to clients.

**Summary of changes:**
- When the database has `unit = "CPS"`, the server now corrects it to `"CPM"` in the response
- Combined with the tool descriptions we added earlier, Claude will now correctly say "CPM (counts per minute)" instead of "CPS (counts per second)"

The changes are ready for you to commit and deploy when you're ready!
