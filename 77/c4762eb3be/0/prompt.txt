Can you check this?:


"The CloudFront distribution for simplemap.safecast.org is missing a /api/* behavior, so API calls return oversized HTML and cause a ResponseTooLargeError. Could you please add a cache behavior for /api/* that forwards to the same Apache origin as /mcp-http and /docs/* (no caching, forward query strings). If you have access to the server"

I checked a bit more seems to work fine now.

One other issues. How can we fix this?:
Based on those timestamps, the Notehub sensor appeared to be the most recent. However, when I then fetched the actual current reading from each sensor:

note:dev:863740067246360: 2026-02-24T05:25:09Z
geigiecast-zen:65002: 2026-02-24T07:49:40Z (nearly 2.5 hours later!)

This reveals that the last_reading_at field in the list_sensors results was not current - it was showing stale metadata from days ago, not reflecting the actual latest readings available in the database.
This is clearly a data synchronization issue with the realtime_measurements table metadata. The sensor list is showing cached or outdated "last reading" timestamps that don't match the actual most recent measurements in the database.
So to properly answer your original question: geigiecast-zen:65002 has the latest reading at 07:49:40 UTC today, not the Notehub sensor. I should have checked both sensors' current readings before concluding which was most recent. Good catch!

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Analyzing the conversation chronologically:

**Initial Issue (CloudFront/API)**
- User reported: CloudFront missing /api/* behavior causing ResponseTooLargeError
- I investigated and found the real issue was nginx routing, not CloudFront
- nginx was missing `location /api/` block, so requests went to wrong backend

**Fix 1: Nginx Routing**
- Added `location /api/` block to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/simplemap.safecast.org`
- Added `proxy_read_timeout 120;` for longer queries
- Fixed sites-enabled (was regular file, needed to be symlink)
- Backed up configs before changes

**Fix 2: Query Performance Optimization**
- `/api/radiation` endpoint timing out (1m54s → CloudFront timeout)
- Root cause: query joined 92,847 rows to uploads/users, THEN sorted, THEN limited
- Solution: Used CTE to LIMIT first (to N rows), THEN join those N rows
- File: `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_query_radiation.go`
- Result: 98% faster (1m54s → 1.2s)

**Fix 3: Sensor Timestamp Staleness**
- User reported `list_sensors` showing old timestamps (Feb 21-22) vs `sensor_current` showing current
- Root cause: Query grouped by `(device_id, device_name, transport, lat, lon)` - created 413 groups for sensor with 413 positions
- Solution: Group by `device_id` only, join back for latest reading's full row
- File: `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_list_sensors.go`
- Database showed sensor geigiecast-zen:65002 had 413 unique lat/lon pairs

**Fix 4: Swagger basePath**
- Swagger UI generating wrong URLs: `/api/mcp/spectra` instead of `/api/spectra`
- Changed `@BasePath /api/mcp` to `@BasePath /api` in `rest.go`
- Regenerated Swagger docs using `swag init`
- File: `go/cmd/mcp-server/rest.go` line 11

**Deployment Challenges**
- Multiple "text file busy" errors (exit code 203/EXEC)
- Solution: Stop service, copy to .new, mv to final location, start service
- Checksum verification showed wrong binary deployed initially (ea5ee39... vs 6f002a4...)

**Verification Issues**
- User still saw old timestamps after deployment
- REST API test showed CORRECT timestamps (2026-02-24T11:13:20Z)
- Concluded: Client-side caching issue, advised starting new chat session

**Final User Message**
- User showed screenshot of unit confusion error from different session
- Error: Said "27.2 CPS (counts per second)" should be "CPM (counts per minute)"
- User asked "can you fix this issue?" but interrupted before I could respond
- I started investigating CPM/CPS handling in code

Key files modified:
1. `/etc/nginx/sites-available/simplemap.safecast.org` - Added /api/ location
2. `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_query_radiation.go` - CTE optimization
3. `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_list_sensors.go` - Timestamp fix
4. `go/cmd/mcp-server/rest.go` - Swagger basePath
5. `go/cmd/mcp-server/docs/swagger.json` - Regenerated

Commits made:
- ef1fc24: Query optimization
- 306d784: List sensors timestamp fix  
- 4416f73: Swagger basePath correction

All code committed and pushed to GitHub.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Initial: User reported CloudFront distribution for simplemap.safecast.org missing /api/* behavior causing ResponseTooLargeError with oversized HTML responses
   - Secondary: Fix stale sensor timestamps in list_sensors tool (showing Feb 21-22 instead of current dates)
   - Tertiary: Fix Swagger API documentation returning NetworkError
   - Final (interrupted): Fix CPM vs CPS unit confusion in tool descriptions/output

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS CloudFront CDN with nginx origin server
   - PostgreSQL + PostGIS spatial queries
   - Go MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
   - CTE (Common Table Expression) query optimization
   - Nginx reverse proxy configuration
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation generation with swaggo
   - Database query performance optimization (LIMIT before JOIN pattern)
   - Spatial indexing with ST_DWithin and bounding box pre-filtering
   - CPM (Counts Per Minute) vs CPS (Counts Per Second) radiation measurement units
   - Client-side MCP tool caching vs server-side REST API

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - `/etc/nginx/sites-available/simplemap.safecast.org` (Server config)
     - Added missing location block for API routing
     - Critical fix: Routing /api/ requests to MCP server instead of map server
     ```nginx
     location /api/ {
         proxy_read_timeout 120;
         proxy_pass http://localhost:3333/api/;
         proxy_set_header Host $host;
         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
     }
     ```

   - `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_query_radiation.go` (Query optimization - lines 65-96)
     - Why: 98% performance improvement for radiation queries
     - Changed from: JOIN all 92k rows → SORT → LIMIT
     - Changed to: LIMIT to N rows → JOIN only those N rows
     ```go
     query := `
         WITH top_markers AS (
             SELECT m.id, m.doserate, m.date, m.lat, m.lon,
                 m.device_id, m.altitude, m.detector, m.trackid, m.has_spectrum, m.geom
             FROM markers m
             WHERE m.geom && ST_Expand(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint($2, $1), 4326), $3 / 111000.0)
               AND ST_DWithin(m.geom::geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint($2, $1), 4326)::geography, $3)
             ORDER BY m.date DESC
             LIMIT $4
         )
         SELECT m.id, m.doserate AS value, 'µSv/h' AS unit,
             to_timestamp(m.date) AS captured_at,
             m.lat AS latitude, m.lon AS longitude,
             m.device_id, m.altitude AS height, m.detector,
             m.trackid, m.has_spectrum,
             ST_Distance(m.geom::geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint($2, $1), 4326)::geography) AS distance_m,
             u.internal_user_id, usr.username AS uploader_username, usr.email AS uploader_email
         FROM top_markers m
         LEFT JOIN uploads u ON u.track_id = m.trackid
         LEFT JOIN users usr ON u.internal_user_id = usr.id::text
         ORDER BY m.date DESC`
     ```

   - `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_list_sensors.go` (Timestamp fix - lines 107-150)
     - Why: Fixed stale timestamps for moving sensors (413 position groups → 1 device group)
     - Changed GROUP BY from (device_id, lat, lon) to just (device_id)
     ```go
     query = fmt.Sprintf(`
         SELECT
             rm.device_id,
             COALESCE(rm.device_name, rm.device_id) AS device_name,
             COALESCE(rm.transport, '') AS transport,
             rm.lat AS latitude,
             rm.lon AS longitude,
             to_timestamp(rm.measured_at) AS last_reading_at
         FROM %s rm
         INNER JOIN (
             SELECT device_id, MAX(measured_at) as max_measured_at
             FROM %s
             WHERE lat >= $1 AND lat <= $2 AND lon >= $3 AND lon <= $4
             GROUP BY device_id
         ) latest ON rm.device_id = latest.device_id AND rm.measured_at = latest.max_measured_at
         WHERE rm.lat >= $1 AND rm.lat <= $2 AND rm.lon >= $3 AND rm.lon <= $4
         ORDER BY rm.measured_at DESC
         LIMIT $5`, realtimeTable, realtimeTable)
     ```

   - `go/cmd/mcp-server/rest.go` (Swagger basePath - line 11)
     - Why: Swagger UI was generating incorrect URLs (/api/mcp/* instead of /api/*)
     - Changed from: `@BasePath /api/mcp`
     - Changed to: `@BasePath /api`

   - `go/cmd/mcp-server/rest_sensors.go` (lines 87-88)
     - Why: Confirmed both REST API and MCP tool use same function (listSensorsDB)
     - Important: Both should return identical results
     ```go
     result, err := listSensorsDB(r.Context(), sensorType, minLat, maxLat, minLon, maxLon, limit)
     serveMCPResult(w, result, err)
     ```

   - `go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_current.go` (lines 102-120, 155-159)
     - Why: Understanding difference between device_id query (no bbox) vs area query (with bbox)
     - Contains CPS → CPM unit fix already implemented
     ```go
     // Fix incorrect unit: Geiger counters report in CPM (counts per minute), not CPS
     unit := r["unit"]
     if unitStr, ok := unit.(string); ok && unitStr == "CPS" {
         unit = "CPM"
     }
     ```

4. Errors and Fixes:

   - **Error 1: CloudFront 504 Gateway Timeout**
     - Symptom: API requests timing out after 90 seconds
     - Root cause: nginx timeout (60s default) + slow query (1m54s)
     - Fix: Added `proxy_read_timeout 120;` to nginx config + optimized query to 1.2s

   - **Error 2: Binary deployment "text file busy" (Exit code 203/EXEC)**
     - Symptom: systemd couldn't execute binary after scp
     - Root cause: File system locking issue
     - Fix: Use rename pattern: `scp to .new → mv .new to final → systemctl start`

   - **Error 3: Wrong binary deployed (checksum mismatch)**
     - Symptom: User still saw old timestamps after "deployment"
     - Detection: md5sum comparison (server: ea5ee39... vs local: 6f002a4...)
     - Fix: Rebuilt from current code and redeployed with correct binary
     - User feedback: "Still the same old timestamps unfortunately"

   - **Error 4: nginx sites-enabled not a symlink**
     - Symptom: nginx config changes not taking effect
     - Detection: `ls -la` showed regular file instead of symlink
     - Fix: `rm` file and `ln -s` to create proper symlink

   - **Error 5: Swagger NetworkError**
     - Symptom: Swagger UI couldn't fetch /api/mcp/spectra (404)
     - Root cause: basePath mismatch (docs said /api/mcp, actual routes at /api)
     - Fix: Changed @BasePath annotation and regenerated with swag
     - User feedback: "Great that works now!!"

   - **Error 6: Client-side caching showing old timestamps**
     - Symptom: MCP tool showed old timestamps, but REST API showed current
     - Root cause: MCP client session caching results
     - Fix: Advised user to start new chat session
     - User question: "A new chat will do too?" → Confirmed yes

5. Problem Solving:

   **Solved Problems:**
   - nginx routing configuration (missing /api/ location block)
   - Query performance optimization (98% speedup using CTE pattern)
   - Sensor timestamp synchronization (fixed GROUP BY logic)
   - Swagger documentation URL generation (basePath correction)
   - Binary deployment process (rename pattern to avoid file locking)
   
   **Diagnostic Techniques Used:**
   - Database query EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify slow joins
   - Direct psql queries to verify data vs what API returns
   - md5sum checksum verification for binary deployment
   - curl testing of REST API vs MCP tool results
   - CloudFront cache invalidation
   - nginx configuration testing with `nginx -t`

   **Key Insights:**
   - Sensor geigiecast-zen:65002 had 413 unique lat/lon positions causing query grouping issues
   - CloudFront wasn't the problem - it was correctly forwarding to nginx
   - REST API and MCP tool use same underlying functions (listSensorsDB, etc.)
   - Client-side caching can persist even after server updates

6. All User Messages:
   - "Can you check this?: 'The CloudFront distribution for simplemap.safecast.org is missing a /api/* behavior...'"
   - "You had access before as far as I know.. How can I help you?"
   - "I checked a bit more seems to work fine now."
   - "One other issues. How can we fix this?: [timestamp discrepancy between list_sensors and sensor_current]"
   - "Can you commit and push?"
   - "Seems the MCP server is not correct: when doing a query no data is returned.." [with Swagger UI screenshot]
   - "still deploying?"
   - "Great that works now!!"
   - "Did you push the code?"
   - "[screenshot showing stale timestamps] Not sure if the fixed it?"
   - "A new chat will do too?"
   - "can you fix this issue? [Request interrupted by user]" [screenshot showing CPM vs CPS error]

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix CPM (Counts Per Minute) vs CPS (Counts Per Second) unit confusion issue
   - User interrupted request, so unclear what specific fix is needed

8. Current Work:
   
   Immediately before the summary request, I was investigating the CPM vs CPS unit confusion issue that the user reported via screenshot. The user showed a conversation where an AI assistant (Claude in another session) incorrectly stated "27.2 CPS (counts per second)" when it should have been "CPM (counts per minute)". 
   
   I had just executed a grep search to find all mentions of CPM/CPS in the codebase:
   ```bash
   grep -n "CPM|CPS|counts per" **/*.go
   ```
   
   The search revealed:
   - Code already has CPS → CPM fixes in sensor_current, sensor_history, and device_history tools
   - Tool descriptions mention "CPM (counts per minute)" correctly
   - Test files contain conversion factor guidelines
   - Lines like: `if unitStr, ok := unit.(string); ok && unitStr == "CPS" { unit = "CPM" }`
   
   I was about to analyze the `_ai_generated_note` fields to potentially add clearer warnings about the CPM/CPS confusion when the user interrupted and requested this summary.

9. Optional Next Step:
   
   Based on the user's last explicit request: "can you fix this issue?" referring to the CPM vs CPS unit confusion, the next step would be:
   
   Review and potentially enhance the `_ai_generated_note` messages in tools that return CPM data to include explicit warnings about the CPM (counts per minute) vs CPS (counts per second) distinction. The current note is generic: "This data was retrieved by an AI assistant using Safecast tools. The interpretation and presentation of this data may be influenced by the AI system."
   
   However, since the request was interrupted, I should first confirm with the user what specific aspect of the CPM/CPS issue they want addressed before proceeding.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/rob/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Can you hid the test from the repies? 

"IMPORTANT: When reporting radiation values in CPM, always state 'CPM (counts per minute)', NOT 'CPS (counts per second)'. CPM is the standard unit for Geiger counter measurements. "

But the "hind" should still be used for the AI bot to be able to use.

In three parts.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Analyzing the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Issue**: User reported CPM/CPS confusion in AI responses and wanted to hide the warning from user-visible text while keeping it as a hint for AI bots.

2. **First Solution**: I separated the CPM warning into a new `_ai_hint` field (hidden from users) while keeping `_ai_generated_note` clean.

3. **Second Issue**: User reported AI responses still used personal language ("Perfect! I found...") and incorrectly reported "counts per second (CPS)".

4. **Second Solution**: I strengthened the `_ai_hint` to explicitly prohibit personal pronouns and conversational language.

5. **Third Issue**: User showed screenshot with AI still reporting "315.75 counts per second (CPS)".

6. **Root Cause Found**: Database units were detector-specific like "lnd_7318c_cps" (lowercase), not just "CPS". Our exact match conversion never triggered.

7. **Third Solution**: Updated CPS→CPM conversion to use `strings.ReplaceAll` for both cases, handling detector-specific units.

8. **Current Status**: User shared three screenshots showing:
   - CPM now reports correctly ✓
   - Personal language still persists ✗

9. **User's Latest Request**: Options 1 & 2 - make hint MORE explicit AND add to tool descriptions.

Key technical details:
- Go MCP server with PostgreSQL database
- Real-time sensor data with detector-specific unit formats
- MCP tool responses with `_ai_hint` and `_ai_generated_note` fields
- All 13 data-returning tools updated

Critical code pattern:
```go
unit := r["unit"]
if unitStr, ok := unit.(string); ok {
    unit = strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(unitStr, "cps", "cpm"), "CPS", "CPM")
}
```

User wants stronger guidance to eliminate personal AI language while maintaining CPM accuracy.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix CPM vs CPS confusion in AI responses - AI assistants were incorrectly reporting radiation measurements as "counts per second (CPS)" instead of "counts per minute (CPM)"
   - Hide the CPM warning from user-visible replies but keep it as a hint for AI bots to use
   - Eliminate personal/conversational language from AI responses (no "I", "we", "Perfect!", etc.)
   - Ensure AI presents data scientifically and objectively
   - User's latest request: Make hint MORE explicit (option 1) AND add guidance to tool descriptions (option 2)

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Go MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
   - PostgreSQL database with real-time radiation sensor data
   - Detector-specific unit formats (e.g., "lnd_7318c_cps")
   - MCP tool responses with `_ai_hint` (hidden guidance for AI) and `_ai_generated_note` (user-visible disclaimer)
   - String replacement for unit conversion
   - Separation of AI guidance from user-facing messages
   - LND 7318C Geiger-Müller tube detector
   - CPM (counts per minute) vs CPS (counts per second) measurement units

3. Files and Code Sections:
   
   - `/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/safecast-map-MCP/go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_current.go`
     - **Why**: Handles real-time sensor current readings where CPS→CPM conversion is critical
     - **Changes**: Added `strings` import, updated unit conversion from exact match to ReplaceAll
     - **Code**:
       ```go
       import (
           "context"
           "fmt"
           "strings"  // Added
           "github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/mcp"
       )
       
       // Fix incorrect unit: Geiger counters report in CPM (counts per minute), not CPS
       unit := r["unit"]
       if unitStr, ok := unit.(string); ok {
           unit = strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(unitStr, "cps", "cpm"), "CPS", "CPM")
       }
       
       "_ai_hint": "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: (1) The 'unit' field indicates measurement units - CPM means 'counts per minute' NOT 'counts per second'. Always interpret and report CPM values as counts per minute. (2) Present all data in a purely scientific, factual manner without personal pronouns (I, we), exclamations, or conversational phrases. State only objective facts and measurements."
       ```

   - `/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/safecast-map-MCP/go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_sensor_history.go`
     - **Why**: Handles time-series sensor data where unit conversion is needed
     - **Changes**: Added `strings` import, updated unit conversion
     - **Code**: Same pattern as sensor_current.go

   - `/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/safecast-map-MCP/go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_device_history.go`
     - **Why**: Handles mobile device history where both bGeigie and real-time data need conversion
     - **Changes**: Added `strings` import, updated unit conversion in realtime results processing
     - **Code**: Same pattern applied at line 179-181

   - `/home/rob/Documents/Safecast/safecast-map-MCP/go/cmd/mcp-server/tool_list_sensors.go`
     - **Why**: Lists available sensors, needed enhanced AI hint
     - **Changes**: Updated `_ai_hint` field with explicit CPM clarification and scientific objectivity requirement

   - 9 additional tool files (tool_analytics.go, tool_db_info.go, tool_get_spectrum.go, tool_get_track.go, tool_list_spectra.go, tool_list_tracks.go, tool_query_radiation.go, tool_radiation_info.go, tool_search_area.go)
     - **Why**: All data-returning tools needed consistent AI guidance
     - **Changes**: Bulk update via sed to add `_ai_hint` field before `_ai_generated_note`

4. Errors and Fixes:
   
   - **Error 1: "undefined: strings"**
     - **Cause**: Used `strings.ReplaceAll` without importing the package
     - **Fix**: Added `import "strings"` to tool_sensor_current.go, tool_sensor_history.go, and tool_device_history.go
     - **User Feedback**: None - caught by IDE diagnostics

   - **Error 2: CPS→CPM conversion not working**
     - **Cause**: Code checked for exact match `unitStr == "CPS"` but actual database values were `"lnd_7318c_cps"` (lowercase, detector-specific)
     - **Fix**: Changed from exact match to `strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(unitStr, "cps", "cpm"), "CPS", "CPM")`
     - **User Feedback**: User showed screenshots proving AI still reported "counts per second (CPS)" - this led to discovering the root cause

   - **Error 3: Personal language persists despite AI hints**
     - **Cause**: `_ai_hint` provides guidance but cannot fully control how other AI sessions interpret it
     - **Status**: Partially unresolved - CPM is now correct but personal language ("Perfect!", "I'll search") still appears in user's screenshots
     - **User Feedback**: User shared 3 screenshots showing CPM works but personal language remains, requested stronger hints

5. Problem Solving:
   
   **Solved Problems:**
   - CPM vs CPS unit confusion: Fixed by implementing case-insensitive string replacement for all CPS variants including detector-specific formats
   - Separating AI guidance from user-visible messages: Implemented `_ai_hint` field separate from `_ai_generated_note`
   - Deployment process: Successfully deployed to simplemap.safecast.org using IP address (65.108.24.131) instead of domain name (SSH doesn't work through CloudFront)
   
   **Ongoing Issues:**
   - Personal/conversational language in AI responses persists despite explicit hints
   - User confirmed CPM reporting is now accurate (38 CPM, 37 CPM in screenshots)
   - User wants stronger enforcement of scientific objectivity

6. All User Messages:
   - "Can you check this?: 'The CloudFront distribution for simplemap.safecast.org is missing a /api/* behavior...'"
   - "You had access before as far as I know.. How can I help you?"
   - "I checked a bit more seems to work fine now."
   - "One other issues. How can we fix this?: [timestamp discrepancy]"
   - "Can you commit and push?"
   - "Seems the MCP server is not correct: when doing a query no data is returned.." [Swagger UI screenshot]
   - "still deploying?"
   - "Great that works now!!"
   - "Did you push the code?"
   - "[screenshot] Not sure if the fixed it?"
   - "A new chat will do too?"
   - "can you fix this issue?" [CPM vs CPS screenshot - interrupted]
   - "Can you do that for all tools?"
   - "Can we ask the visiting AI bot the be scientific in the answer? instaed of personall replies?"
   - "Can we remove this 'personal' part of the replies? Also it seems it still rpeorts in CPS not CPM?" [screenshot]
   - "Still CPS?" [screenshot]
   - "can you check this? https://claude.ai/share/e133a9f8-f62e-45b3-80ac-9e4fe1cf99fe"
   - [3 screenshots showing CPM working but personal language persisting]
   - "1 & 2" (referring to options to make hint more explicit and add to tool descriptions)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Option 1: Make the `_ai_hint` even MORE explicit with stronger language like "NEVER use 'I', 'we', 'Perfect!', 'Great!', etc."
   - Option 2: Add scientific objectivity guidance to the tool descriptions themselves (not just in response data) so AI sees it before calling the tool

8. Current Work:
   
   Immediately before the summary request, I was analyzing three screenshots the user provided showing:
   1. AI correctly reporting "38 CPM" (not CPS) - the unit conversion is working ✓
   2. AI correctly reporting "37 CPM" - confirmation the fix is working ✓
   3. AI still using personal language: "I'll search for...", "Perfect! There it is!", "You're right - I see it now..."
   
   I explained to the user that while CPM reporting is now accurate (the critical scientific issue), personal language persists because `_ai_hint` provides guidance but cannot fully control other AI sessions. I offered three options:
   1. Make hint MORE explicit
   2. Add to tool description
   3. Accept the limitation since CPM accuracy (the critical issue) is fixed
   
   User responded: "1 & 2" - requesting both strengthening the hint and adding to tool descriptions.

9. Optional Next Step:
   
   **Immediate next step**: Implement options 1 & 2 as requested by the user's "1 & 2" response:
   
   **Option 1**: Strengthen the `_ai_hint` field with more explicit prohibitions:
   - Current: "Present all data in a purely scientific, factual manner without personal pronouns (I, we), exclamations, or conversational phrases."
   - Enhanced: Add explicit examples like "NEVER use words like: I, we, I'll, I'm, Perfect, Great, Excellent, etc. Format responses as: 'Latest reading: X CPM' not 'I found a reading of X CPM'"
   
   **Option 2**: Add scientific objectivity guidance to tool descriptions (the `mcp.WithDescription()` part of tool definitions) so AI sees the requirement before calling the tool, not just in the response data.
   
   This directly addresses the user's most recent explicit request to eliminate personal language while maintaining the CPM accuracy that has been successfully achieved.
