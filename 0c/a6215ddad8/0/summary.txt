It works perfectly. Claude CLI used the Safecast MCP tools to query real radiation data and returned a detailed response.

**Summary:** The test is at [test/claude_web.go](test/claude_web.go). It's a simple Go web server that:

1. Serves an HTML chat page at `http://localhost:8080`
2. On user input, calls `claude -p` with `--allowedTools "mcp__claude_ai_Safecast_MCP__*"` — no bridge needed
3. Claude CLI already has the MCP server configured, so it calls tools directly
4. Returns the response to the browser

**Key differences from the Qwen approach:**
- No bridge server needed
- No API keys to manage
- No custom MCP client code — Claude CLI handles the MCP protocol natively
- Just one file, ~100 lines of Go

To run it independently: `go run test/claude_web.go` then open `http://localhost:8080`.
