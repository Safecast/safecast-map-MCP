Now we use Cloudfront for DNS of simplemap.safecast.org, does rsync still works with ssh to simplemap.safecast.org?

Can you update all the documentaion in the repo that need to be updated for this chnage?

---

Can you do the same for the repo I add for the MCP server? And check if we need to modify the MCP server to work correctly with the new Cloudfront setup?

---

Can you do this?:

You must update the MAP_SERVER_HOST secret in the MCP server repository:

Go to safecast-map-MCP repository on GitHub
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
Update MAP_SERVER_HOST from simplemap.safecast.org to 65.108.24.131
