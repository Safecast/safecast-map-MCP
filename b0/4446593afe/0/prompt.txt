Did you commit and pushed the code?

For this kind data we need to have it in a table format the be more readable.

That looks great now.

1- make the downlaod button the same blue color as the rest of the buttons.

One more thnig, if sensors are show can you always add the latest radiation level and coordinates?

Links work, but the map should get coordinates for the device and instiruct the map to go to there, not a device name.
